# Crack Detection Model

This repository contains the code and documentation for a deep learning model developed for crack detection. The model achieves excellent performance in crack detection, as indicated by a recall of 1.00, precision of 0.98, and an F-score of 0.99 on the test set.

## Features

- Developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Leveraged transfer learning with the InceptionV3 pre-trained model for feature extraction.
- Applied data augmentation techniques to increase model robustness.
- Implemented a web-based dashboard using Gradio for user interaction.
- Ensured security and authentication measures for the dashboard.
- Collaborated with a team to deploy the model on a cloud server.

## Usage

1. Run `problem-1(Surface-Crack).ipynb` to train the crack detection model evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
2. Launch the web-based dashboard: `problem-1 with dashboard(Surface-Crack).ipynb`

## Results

The model achieved a recall of 1.00, precision of 0.98, and an F-score of 0.99 on the test set, indicating its high robustness and accuracy in crack detection.
